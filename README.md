# C Language Learning Guide

This repository contains a single, comprehensive C file (`leran.c`) designed as a hands-on reference guide for learning the C programming language.

## About This Project

This C program is structured into seven distinct "levels," each encapsulated in its own function. It's designed to be read top-to-bottom, guiding a learner from the absolute basics to advanced, complex topics. All concepts are demonstrated with clear, commented code examples.

### Topics Covered:

* **Level 1: The Bare Essentials:** Variables, data types, `printf` / `scanf`, and constants.
* **Level 2: Operations & Control Flow:** Arithmetic/logical operators, `if`/`else if`/`else`, `switch` statements, and `for`/`while` loops.
* **Level 3: Functions & Pointers:** Creating functions, understanding `return` types, and the fundamentals of pointers and pass-by-reference.
* **Level 4: Complex Data Structures:** 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays, C-style strings, and common functions from `<string.h>`.
* **Level 5: Custom Structures & Memory:** Creating custom data types with `struct` and `typedef`, and managing memory with `malloc` and `free`.
* **Level 6: Advanced Topics:** Reading from and writing to files (File I/O) and the use of function pointers.
* **Level 7: OOP Simulation:** An advanced example of how to simulate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, methods, and constructors in C.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository and compile the file to see the output of every example.

### Compile and Run
